Q)What does fast-forward in git mean?
A)Fast-forward merges literally move the tip of your main branch to the end of your feature branch. This keeps all feature branch commits sequential while integrating them neatly back into your main branch. 

Q)Why should you have different branches?
A)Developers frequently work on the same original code. With different Branches in git, the developer can isolate their work from the original code and then seamlessly merge their work into the original code.

Q)In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?
A)Based on the needs of the project, a project may have multiple remote git repositories. As a result, many teams in the project can work on the same source code at the same time.
